# Movie Recommender Project

## Introduction
This project is a movie recommender system that suggests movies based on user preferences and movie features. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Packages Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Streamlit

## Algorithms and Methodologies Used
The movie recommender system employs the following techniques:
- Content-based filtering
- Cosine similarity
- CountVectorizer
- Porter Stemmer

## Accuracy
The accuracy of the movie recommender system is based on the similarity of movie features and user preferences. The system aims to provide relevant movie recommendations based on the user's input and historical data.

## Prediction Performance
The system's prediction performance is evaluated based on how closely the recommended movies match the user's preferences. The accuracy of predictions is influenced by the quality of data, feature engineering, and the effectiveness of the recommendation algorithms.

## Usage
To run the movie recommender system:
1. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
3. Input your preferences and get personalized movie recommendations.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating collaborative filtering techniques
- Enhancing the recommendation engine with user feedback loops
- Implementing a user interface for better user interaction
