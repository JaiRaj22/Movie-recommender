# Movie Recommender Project

## Introduction
This project is a movie recommender system that suggests movies based on user preferences and movie features. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Packages Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Streamlit

## Algorithms and Methodologies Used
### Content-based Filtering
Content-based filtering recommends items based on the similarity of their features to the user's preferences. In this project, movie recommendations are made by comparing movie features such as genres, keywords, and cast.

### Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two items are based on their features. In the movie recommender system, cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between movies and provide recommendations based on the most similar items.

### CountVectorizer
CountVectorizer is a technique used to convert text data into numerical features. In this project, CountVectorizer is applied to process textual data such as movie overviews and tags to extract meaningful information for recommendation.

### Porter Stemmer
Porter Stemmer is a natural language processing technique used to reduce words to their root or base form. It helps in standardizing and simplifying text data, making it easier to process and analyze for recommendation purposes.

## Accuracy
The accuracy of the movie recommender system is based on the similarity of movie features and user preferences. The system aims to provide relevant movie recommendations based on the user's input and historical data.

## Prediction Performance
The system's prediction performance is evaluated based on how closely the recommended movies match the user's preferences. The accuracy of predictions is influenced by the quality of data, feature engineering, and the effectiveness of the recommendation algorithms.

## Usage
To run the movie recommender system:
1. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
3. Input your preferences and get personalized movie recommendations.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating collaborative filtering techniques
- Enhancing the recommendation engine with user feedback loops
- Implementing a user interface for better user interaction
